# Dotfiles by Alex Palcuie

Hacking like a geek:

* My main machine is a Mac. But the configurations also work on a Linux remote machine
* ZSH shell with oh_my_zsh and custom stuff
* VIM provisioned with Vundle
* AppleScripts that automate my work

# Setup for new Mac

1. Update the computer to the last version
2. Install XCode and `xcode-select --install`
